Star King
====================================

"Star King" is a large spaceship battle game on the currency chain. Game mining and invitation revenues are completely distributed on the decentralized chain, and are fair and transparent.

There are 5 levels in the spaceship. After the highest level, there are also "invincible fighters", which can be upgraded for unlimited players. The more the number of ships, the higher the level, the more combatable, the higher the player's income! "Star King" players can get BYC tokens by purchasing spaceships, upgrades, and battles, and can continue to earn revenue for many days. The more gems a player spends, the more BYC tokens they can get.

By constantly buying spaceships, players get more BYC daily and can be sold on exchanges, making daily loops to make money. The maximum return ratio of a single user investment is 80%, and the spacecraft can continue to generate uninterrupted income for many days.

The "Star King" game platform permanently supports token exchange, and uses the Star Alliance protocol to send game players the proceeds of their games. Players will also have the right to draw lucky prizes and enter the game ecology with a small amount of interest.
